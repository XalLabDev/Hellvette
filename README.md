# Hellvette Development Documentation

## Overview
An old school project I'd like to revive and learn video game coding at the same time.
Game is in very early development stages, and so are my skills as a developer.
I hope not to abandon this project and repository.

## Current Features
- Launches.
- Has a main menu.
- Has music.
- That's it :D

# TO-DO
- Fix old ugly sprites
- Make sure the game functions
- Write a plot for the game
- conceptualize possible combat, character building, movement etc. mechanics
